Commits Summary:
------------------------------------
8b0864c - Safwan Chowdhury, 4 days ago : experimenting with max speed
ec6d7f8 - Safwan Chowdhury, 2 weeks ago : Hard limited the h value to prevent excess energy, this seems to have solved the issue of distant spawning dots but is only a temporary fix. Main issue still needs to be identified. Theory is that they are basing energy off of x0 y0.
e8ef048 - Safwan Chowdhury, 2 weeks ago : correction to previous. anything above 6 robots does not work , it does not follow the same pattern
83b8997 - Safwan Chowdhury, 2 weeks ago : Latest experimentation seems to show that the number of robots is directly tied to the SIGMA_FACTOR_MASTERSLAVE. so if ther number of robots is 2 then sigma can be 1 if 4 then sigma needs to be 0.8 if 6 then sigma 0.6 and so on
3c32451 - Safwan Chowdhury, 2 weeks ago : convoy working for 2 robots
b68bb6f - Safwan Chowdhury, 2 weeks ago : grid
6d9c313 - Safwan Chowdhury, 4 weeks ago : found seg fault with the jacobian function for the MasterSlaveFactor. Removed J_func but now dots have disappeared completely. Master slave connections have been successfully demonstrated but need to be refined
9da955c - Safwan Chowdhury, 4 weeks ago : Add SIGMA_FACTOR_MASTERSLAVE parameter to circle_cluttered.json
5c26db2 - Safwan Chowdhury, 4 weeks ago : restore previous state
86b20dc - Safwan Chowdhury, 4 weeks ago : error in compilation
7a18fab - Safwan Chowdhury, 4 weeks ago : updated some simulator parameters and updated factor
5ffcd26 - Safwan Chowdhury, 4 weeks ago : updated to include jacobian
348da6f - Safwan Chowdhury, 4 weeks ago : Group movement achieved!!!
396b099 - Safwan Chowdhury, 4 weeks ago : updated factor.h and factor.cpp with master-slave scaffolding
04ae254 - Safwan Chowdhury, 4 weeks ago : Refactor robot creation logic in Simulator.cpp to include master-slave relationship
be7fc65 - Safwan Chowdhury, 4 weeks ago : Fix member variable names in Simulator.cpp
3b22c30 - Safwan Chowdhury, 4 weeks ago : draw lines between master and slave
669b81a - Safwan Chowdhury, 4 weeks ago : Refactor robot creation logic in Simulator.cpp to include master-slave relationship
